Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz<br>And I'll be doing whatever snow does<br>In summer<br>A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand<br>Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned<br>In summer<br><br>I'll finally see a summer breeze blow away a winter storm<br>And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm<br>And I can't wait to see what my buddies all think of me<br>Just imagine how much cooler I'll be<br>In summer<br><br>Da da, da doo, ah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, boo<br>The hot and the cold are both so intense<br>Put 'em together, it just makes sense<br>Ratdadat, dadadadoo<br>Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle<br>But put me in summer and I'll be a happy snowman<br><br>When life gets rough I like to hold onto my dreams<br>Of relaxing in the summer sun, just letting off steam<br>Oh, the sky will be blue, and you guys'll be there too<br>When I finally do what frozen things do<br>In summer<br>In summer!
