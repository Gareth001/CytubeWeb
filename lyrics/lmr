Though I may speak some tongue of old<br>Or even spit out some holy word<br>I have no strength with which to speak<br>When you sit me down and see I'm weak<br><br>We will run and scream<br>You will dance with me<br>We'll fulfill our dreams<br>And we'll be free<br><br>We will run and scream<br>You will dance with me<br>We'll fulfill our dreams<br>And we'll be free<br><br>We will be who we are<br>And they'll heal our scars<br>Sadness will be far away<br><br>So I have done wrong to put me right<br>My judgement burned in black of night<br>Then I give less than I take<br>It is my fault, my own mistake<br><br>We will run and scream<br>You will dance with me<br>We'll fulfill our dreams<br>And we'll be free<br><br>We will be who we are<br>And they'll heal our scars<br>Sadness will be far away
