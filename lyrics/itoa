This love it is a distant star<br>Guiding us home wherever we are<br>This love it is a burning sun<br>Shining a light on the things that we've done<br><br>I tried to speak to you every day<br>But each word we spoke the wind blew away<br><br>How did we let it come to this?<br>What we've just tasted we somehow still miss<br>How will it feel when this day is done?<br>And can we keep what we've only begun?<br><br>Could these walls come crumbling down?<br>I want to feel my feet on the ground<br>Can we carry this love that we share?<br>Into the open air<br>Into the open air<br>Into the open air<br><br>This love it is a burning sun
