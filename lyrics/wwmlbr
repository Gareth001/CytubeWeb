Look at the world, so close, and I'm halfway to it<br>Look at it all, so big, do I even dare?<br>Look at me, there at last, I just have to do it<br>Should I?<br>No<br>Here I go<br><br>Just smell the grass, the dirt, just like I dreamed they'd be<br>Just feel that summer breeze, the way it's calling me<br>For like the first time ever, I'm completely free<br><br>I could go running<br>And racing<br>And dancing<br>And chasing<br>And leaping<br>And bounding<br>Hair flying<br>Heart pounding<br>And splashing<br>And reeling<br>And finally feeling<br>Now's when my life begins!
