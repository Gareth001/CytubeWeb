When the cold wind is a'calling<br>And the sky is clear and bright<br>Misty mountains sing and beckon<br>Lead me out into the light<br><br>I will ride, I will fly<br>Chase the wind and touch the sky<br>I will fly<br>Chase the wind and touch the sky<br><br>Where dark woods hide secrets<br>And mountains are fierce and bold<br>Deep waters hold reflections<br>Of times lost long ago<br><br>I will hear their every story<br>Take hold of my own dream<br>Be as strong as the seas are stormy<br>And proud as an eagle's scream<br><br>I will ride, I will fly<br>Chase the wind and touch the sky<br>I will fly<br>Chase the wind and touch the sky<br><br><br>And touch the sky<br>Chase the wind<br>Chase the wind<br>Touch the sky
